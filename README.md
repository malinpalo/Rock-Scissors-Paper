* ### Features left to implement
 I would like to implement:

  * a countdown for moves left.

# Design<div id='id-design'>
* ### Colours
I've been trying to get good visibility using the contrast of the different colors so that the visually impaired can easily see everything that is written.
I've been trying to make the websight look a bit like taken from the 80's game world with bright colors. The background is in different colors, blue, purple, black to stand in contrast with the chosen colors.
   
* ### Colour Palette

# Bugs<div id='id-bugs'>
* ### Fixed Bugs 
   * I could not get the text for what the computer chose running so I removed the function.
   * Console error became present preventing execution of script code after the last tidy up, before deployment, where I removed some html code. I've solved that error by reinserting the code.
